## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD pipelines

- **CRON Jobs** — for scheduled workflows
- **YAML** — defining workflow logic

## 📌 Labs Overview

### ✅ Lab 1: Hello World (GitHub Actions)
> This is the first GitHub Actions workflow to verify that the GitHub CI/CD pipeline is triggered correctly and runs a basic script.

### 🔁 Lab 2: Trigger by GitHub Events
> Execute CI/CD tasks when specific repository events occur (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).

### 🔗 Lab 3: Cross-Repo Dispatch with GitHub API
> Use `repository_dispatch` to trigger workflows across repositories using GitHub API and Personal Access Tokens (PAT).

### ⏰ Lab 4: Schedule and Manual Triggers
> Combine scheduled CRON triggers and manual UI/API triggers in one workflow.
